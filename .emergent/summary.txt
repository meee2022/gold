<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a mobile-first Arabic (RTL) web app named زينة وخزينة (ZEINA & KHAZINA) for gold trading and a marketplace for jewelry.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Tech Stack:** React + FastAPI + MongoDB.
- **Design:** A luxurious Black & Gold theme, mobile-first responsive design, closely matching the provided UI screenshots. The app must be entirely in Arabic (RTL).
- **Core Features:**
    1.  **Home Page:** Display live gold prices (from Metals.live API), a hero banner, and quick access cards.
    2.  **Investment Section:** Allow users to digitally buy/sell gold. It must include a gold calculator based on weight and karat.
    3.  **Store:** Originally a single section, it has been split into:
        -   **Jewelry Store:** For trusted merchants.
        -   **Qatari Designers Section:** A separate section to showcase specific Qatari jewelry designers and their products.
    4.  **Gifts Section:** For giftable gold items with customizable greeting messages.
    5.  **Sharia Compliance:** A mandatory agreement page users must accept before investing.
    6.  **Authentication:** Support for both Email/Password and Google Social Login.
    7.  **Shopping Cart:** A functional cart where users can add jewelry, designer products, and custom gold investments.
    8.  **Admin Role:** An admin user (credentials provided) to manage products and merchants.
- **Database:** The user provided a MongoDB Atlas URI, but due to connection issues, the agent switched to a local MongoDB instance.

**User's preferred language**: العربية (Arabic). The next agent MUST respond in Arabic only.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been developed with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The backend is connected to a local MongoDB and has seeded data for gold prices, products, and designers. The frontend implements the requested black and gold, RTL, mobile-first design.

Key implemented features include:
- A home page with (seeded) gold prices.
- An investment page with a functional gold calculator.
- A functional shopping cart integrated with the investment and product pages.
- A bottom navigation bar with icons for Home, Store, Cart, and Investment.
- Backend APIs for authentication, products, designers, cart, and wallet.
- User authentication (email/password).

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was addressing a user complaint that the Qatari Designers page was incorrectly displaying jewelry content. The agent identified that the routes for the newly created  and  were missing in  and applied a fix. However, before verifying the fix, the user submitted a new request to add About and Sharia pages.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0):** Qatari Designers page displays the wrong content.
- **Issue 2 (P1):** The initial MongoDB Atlas connection provided by the user failed.

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:** Qatari Designers page displays the wrong content
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent added the missing routes for  and  in . The fix has not been tested yet.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Restart the frontend service and take a screenshot of the  page to verify it loads the correct component ().
        2.  Confirm that the  component fetches data from the  endpoint.
        3.  Ensure the page correctly renders the list of designers.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a key feature. Fixing it will correctly display the designers' section as requested by the user.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None

- **Issue 2:** MongoDB Atlas Connection Failure
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent tried adding , which did not resolve the SSL error. As a workaround, the agent switched to the local MongoDB instance.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Investigate the SSL error in the backend logs.
        2.  Try reconnecting to the user's MongoDB Atlas URI using  in the  constructor within .
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The user's data should be persistent in their own database. The local DB is a temporary solution.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1:** Finalize the separation of the Qatari Designers section.
    - **Where to resume:** The core files (, ) have been created and routes have been added. The immediate step is to verify the fix for **Issue 1** and ensure the navigation and page content are correct.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The app's navigation structure will match the user's request, with Jewelry and Designers as distinct sections.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    - **Blocked on something:** Issue 1

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P1: Create About and Sharia Pages:**
        - Create a new page  based on the user's screenshot.
        - Update  based on the screenshot.
        - Add routes for these pages in .
        - Add links to these new pages in the user's profile/settings page ().
    - **P1: Update Bottom Navigation:**

    - **P2: Implement Designer Detail Page:**
        - Complete the functionality for  to fetch and display information for a specific designer. This will require a backend endpoint like .
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **P2: Implement Live Gold Prices:**

    - **P3: Full Payment Gateway Integration:**
        - Replace the mocked payment UI with a real payment provider integration (e.g., Stripe).

**All files of reference**
- **/app/backend/server.py**: Contains all backend logic. Recently updated for cart and designer features.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main router. Recently modified to add routes for the designers' pages.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/DesignersPage.js**: Newly created page to list designers. Its content is not displaying correctly.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/DesignerDetailPage.js**: Placeholder page for designer details.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/Navigation.js**: Defines the bottom navigation bar. Needs to be updated with new sections.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/StorePage.js**: Updated to only show jewelry products.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file is monolithic and contains all backend logic. It should be refactored into a modular structure (e.g., separate directories for routes, models, and services).
- Frontend components in files like  could be broken down into smaller, more specific components for better reusability and maintenance.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user's primary language is **Arabic**. All communication MUST be in Arabic.
- The immediate priority is to fix the **Qatari Designers page**, which is showing incorrect content. Verify the route fix in  and ensure the  component works as intended.
- The application is currently using a **local MongoDB instance** due to an SSL connection error with the user's provided Atlas DB. Do not attempt to switch back without a proper SSL fix.
- The user has requested several UI changes simultaneously: creating About and Sharia pages and updating the bottom navigation. Address the critical bug first before proceeding with these new features.
